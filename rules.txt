🧩 Generalized Tower of Hanoi

✅ Problem Definition (n towers, m rings):
You are given:

m rings, each a different size (1 is the smallest, m is the largest).

n towers (or pegs), where typically only one tower starts with all m rings arranged in descending order from bottom to top.

🎯 Goal:
Move all m rings from the source tower to a target tower, with the final stack in ascending order (smallest on top), using n total towers.

⚙️ Rules:
Only one ring can be moved at a time.

You can only move the topmost ring from any tower.

You cannot place a larger ring on top of a smaller ring.

Use the other towers as intermediate storage.

All towers are available for use unless otherwise specified.
