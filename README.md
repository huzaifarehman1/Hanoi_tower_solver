# Hanoi_tower_solver

n (number of towers) -> number of towers in the puzzle
c (capacity) -> number of rings each tower can hold
m (number of rings) -> number of rings in the puzzle must be <= c*n

c must be >=m for it to work

DEFAULT:
    m = 3
    c = 3 
    n = 3

for this version i dont allow user to mess c but new version will be uploaded with c as a variable 

in this version c=m
